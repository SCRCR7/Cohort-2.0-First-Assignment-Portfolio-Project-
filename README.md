# Cohort-2.0 First Assignment Portfolio Project

This is my **first project** at **Sheryians Coding School**.  
It is a **portfolio-style website** made using only **HTML** and **CSS** (Version 1.0).  
The project helped me practice the basics of web development and how to structure a website.

  - **Navigation bar** (fixed at the top).
  - **Hero Section** (title and tagline).

  - **Contact Section**.

## 📂 Code Highlights
### HTML
- Used `<div>` containers to separate sections.  
- Semantic sections with IDs (`about`, `education`, `skills`, etc.).  
- Navigation bar made with `<ul>` and `<li>`.  
- Footer created at the bottom of the page.

### CSS
- `@font-face` → Added custom font (`Love.ttf`).  
- `box-sizing: border-box` → To control spacing and layouts easily.  
- **Colors & Backgrounds** → Different sections have unique background colors.  
- **Flexbox (`display: flex`)** → Used in navigation bar for alignment.  
- **Hover Effects** → Links in navbar change color on hover.  
- **Box-shadow** → Added shadows for hero section and navbar.
